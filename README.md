Hi my name is Berat. I'm intern at Geobilgi Bilişim Teknolojileri. I developed a project in this internship that the project name is Zoo Management System.
This project helps users to see the state of animals. You can add any animal and its state for save it. 
So, what technology did I use while developing this project?
-Java, SpringFramework, SpringBoot, HTML,CSS,JavaScript, REST API, JSON.
